Highcharts Documentation Generators
===================================

This package repository contains the documentation generators to build the
[API documentation](https://api.highcharts.com/).



API Docs
========

This generator is responsible for the `build/api/` product folders in the
`highcharts` repository. It contains a handlebars template system and library
scripts that are used by gulp tasks in the `highcharts` repository. It depends
on the `tree.json` file generated by the JSDoc plugin
`jsdoc/plugins/highcharts.jsdoc.js`. See the included
[readme](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-documentation-generators/blob/master/api-docs/README.md)
for more information.

```js
gulp.src(sourceFiles, { read: false })
    .pipe(jsdoc({
        plugins: ['./tools/jsdoc/plugins/highcharts.jsdoc']
    }, error => console.error(error)));
require('highcharts-documentation-generators')
    .ApiDocs('./tree.json', './build/api', true);
```



DocStrap
========

The generator is not used that much anymore. Basically it provides the template
for JSDoc to generate the `build/api/class-reference` folder in the `highcharts`
repository. The folder of interest is therefor `docstrap/template`. See the
included [readme](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-documentation-generators/blob/master/docstrap/README.md)
for common information.

```js
gulp.src(sourceFiles, { read: false })
    .pipe(require('gulp-jsdoc3')({
        navOptions: {
            theme: 'highsoft'
        },
        opts: {
            template: './node_modules/highcharts-documentation-generators/docstrap'
        },
        templates: {
            theme: 'highsoft'
        }
    }, error => console.error(error)));
```



Parser
======

This new parser creates an AST of source files. The AST containes classes and
options. Every source file ending on `Options` is treated as part of the option
tree. Every source file ending on `Defaults` is treated as a complementary to
options.



TypeDoc
=======

The generator is used for internal documentation of Highcharts. It contains a
handlebars template system and library scripts to generate documentation out of
TypeScript source code.
See the included [readme](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-documentation-generators/blob/master/typedoc/README.md)
for development information.

```js
gulp.src(sourceFiles, { read: false })
    .pipe(require('gulp-typedoc')({
        theme: './node_modules/highcharts-documentation-generators/typedoc/theme'
    })
    .on('error', console.error)
    .on('end', console.log);
```
